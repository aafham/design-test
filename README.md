# design-test

This project is a simple design test website.

The main goal is to experiment with an iOS-style Liquid Glass UI (light and dark mode), not to build a full production app.

## Scope

- Visual design exploration (Liquid Glass look and feel)
- Responsive layout testing (desktop and mobile)
- Basic interactive UI behavior (theme toggle, form validation, micro animations)

## Tech

- `index.html`
- `styles.css`
- `app.js`

No framework or build tool is used.

## Run locally

Open `index.html` directly in your browser.

That is all this repo is for: testing and polishing the Liquid Glass design direction.
